# FCL---Disabled-flat-Task-2-

The fis file contains the fuzzy logic code used for creating an FCL doe disabled flats.

The matlab files are the codes for the function, and the optimization algorithms.

Before the implementation of the optimization algorithms, the files that are necessary for usage should be gotten from the general link.

Thanks
